// Notes:
// - EcoScript uses indentation-aware blocks similar to Python, but also supports explicit { } blocks.
// - Variable declarations are immutable if using `const` (not enforced in MVP yet).
// - Assignment is performed via `let` declarations in MVP; future work will add reassignment operators.
